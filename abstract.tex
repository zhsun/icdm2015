Online adversiting, one typical application of recommendation system,
calls for effective and accurate recommendation for keywords.  Extreme
sparse and large scale data makes online adversiting a challenge
problem. To achieve better performance and accuracy of the
recommendation, a better model with short turnaround time, and able to
handle extremely sparse and large scale data is the key.

In this paper, we address the problem of personlized online
adversiting for extreme sparse and large scale data. We develop a
novel machine learning model (Similarity powered Pairwise Amplifier
Network, {\sppan} for short). The complexity of the model (a.k.a. the
number of parameters) grows with respect to observed data makes it
resilient to extremely sparse data.  The training algorithm based on
gradient descent makes it is easy to parallelize. The similarity model
combines the user neighborhood and item neighborhood ideas in
collaborative filtering smartly, make it handle large scale data in an
cost-effective way.

The proposed framework is evaluated on a large set of real-world data
set in Google AdSense. The experiment results demonstrate that the
proposed {\sppan} model can greatly improve the prediction and
recommendation accuracy on that extreme sparse data set compared with
existing approaches.
