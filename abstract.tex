Sparse data with large scale is one of the most difficulty for most
recommendation systems to make effective recommendation, prediction
and modeling in many scenarios. To achieve better performance and
accuracy of the recommendation system, a better model with
distribution training and serving system is the key.  In this article,
we address the problem of data sparsity and scalability in an online
recommendation system, which can improve the recommendation quality on
a very sparse click-through rate data set. To demonstrate this
improvement, we develop an innovative Similarity Powered Pairwise
Amplifier Network({\sppan}) model, which utilized the pairwise ratio
similarity information embedded in the data set. The proposed
framework is evaluated on a large set of real-world data set in Google
adsSense. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed
{\sppan} model can greatly improve the prediction and recommendation
accuracy on that extreme sparse data set compared with existing
approaches.
